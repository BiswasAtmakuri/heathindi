<p>Dementia is a disorder that affects a person’s memory and cognition and interferes with everyday functioning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But dementia also affects mental health, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/depression-in-dementia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">depression</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease-reports/adr210294" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety</a>&nbsp;among the most common co-occurring symptoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is currently no cure for dementia, but various treatment and lifestyle approaches can help individuals cope with the condition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00422-9/fulltext" target="_blank">new studyTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;by University College London (UCL) researchers suggests that talk therapy may be effective in managing dementia-related depression and anxiety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The findings offer insight into improved treatment approaches for people with dementia.</p>

<h2><a>What to know about dementia-related depression, anxiety</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dementia cannot be categorized as a single disease.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/dementia#types">Types of dementia</a>&nbsp;include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Alzheimer’s disease (AD)</li><li>Lewy body dementia (LBD)</li><li>vascular dementia</li><li>Parkinson’s disease</li><li>frontotemporal dementia</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Across all types of dementia, “it has been reported that 38% of people with mild dementia, 41% with moderate dementia, and 37% with severe dementia have depression,” John noted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She added that risk factors in the development of dementia might include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>social isolation or loneliness</li><li>a reaction to the diagnosis and perceived impacts of the diagnosis</li><li>response to noticing physical and cognitive symptoms</li><li>side effects of medication</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Symptoms of dementia-related anxiety and depression can also vary depending on the stage of dementia a person is in, which could be intense following a diagnosis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Dr.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doctors.columbia.edu/us/ny/new-york/jason-krellman-phd-abpp-cn-710-west-168th-street" target="_blank">Jason Krellman</a>, a neuropsychologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, varying symptoms associated with dementia “are often driven by the affected person’s awareness of the cognitive deficits and the impact on their daily life activities.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Krellman explained that as dementia progresses to moderate or severe, depressive traits may worsen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The person is less able to develop good coping strategies and remember to use these consistently and effectively,” Krellman told Healthline, adding that dementia may also result in apathy and disconnection as it progresses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.brainmindedmd.com/about.html" target="_blank">Reza Hosseini Ghomi</a>, a neuropsychiatrist and co-founder of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.frontier.care/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frontier Psychiatry</a>&nbsp;in Montana, said this level of apathy “is a lack of motivation” that causes a person to retreat from their life and the world around them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s very particular in dementia and very common,” Ghomi told Healthline, adding that in the later stages of dementia, anxiety may also co-occur with other complications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Krellman, certain types of dementia may present a higher risk for depression and anxiety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“People with dementia caused by cerebrovascular disease are more likely to experience psychological distress than those with Alzheimer’s disease dementia,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ghomi added that the type of depression that occurs with dementia is often a unique entity in and of itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Talk therapy for dementia vs. medication</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prescription drugs are typically used to treat depression and anxiety at all ages — but they may not always be suitable for treating symptoms of dementia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dementia apathy, in particular, “responds differently to medication,” Ghomi said, noting that drugs like Prozac and Zoloft may not be as effective for people with dementia. Others, however, such as Citalopram and Celexa, may have a benefit, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not entirely known why some drugs are less effective at treating depression and anxiety among those with dementia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, one theory is that depression in dementia is, as Ghomi put it, “a different biological entity.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This means while medications can create more of a variable response, talk therapy may have the potential to provide benefits on a more universal and wide-reaching scale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Talk therapy, I believe, could be useful for just about anyone,” said Dr.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://siliconpsych.com/" target="_blank">Alex Dimitriu</a>, double board certified in psychiatry and sleep medicine and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry &amp; Sleep Medicine and BrainfoodMD.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Any attention and investigation into the workings of our feelings can reduce depressive or anxious feelings. Awareness alone can go a long way. In the hands of a skilled therapist, these feelings can be identified and ameliorated.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Krellman, talk therapy can help individuals with early dementia:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>get support in dealing with the diagnosis</li><li>learn ways to emotionally cope with cognitive changes</li><li>problem-solve practical issues such as financial planning</li><li>weigh their future care options</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Adapting talk therapy for dementia</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because the UCL study used previously recorded data, John noted they “were only able to identify whether there was a recorded diagnosis of dementia or not.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The researchers, therefore, did not study the stages of dementia among participants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still, John hypothesized that it was “highly likely” the participants with dementia receiving IAPT treatment were in the earlier stages of the condition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this point, she said, they still have many of their faculties and are aware of what’s happening — meaning that traditional therapies, such as CBT, can still be engaged with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But as dementia progresses in a person, there will likely be a “high degree of memory, planning, and language difficulties,” John said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This means talk therapies should be modified accordingly to suit the needs of an individual with dementia depending on the severity of their diagnosis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Reminiscing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dementia impacts short-term memory before longer-term recollections, so many with the condition can still talk about their childhood and earlier years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Reminiscing therapy” involves a therapist or counselor encouraging the individual to share stories and experiences from their past.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scie.org.uk/dementia/living-with-dementia/keeping-active/reminiscence.asp" target="_blank">Social Care Institute of Excellence</a>, reminiscing “can give people with dementia a sense of competence and confidence.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reminiscing approach can be extended outside of talking, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve found that, in people with moderate dementia, putting them in an environment where they’re reminded of their younger days, [such as playing] music they used to listen to, really has a positive effect,” Ghomi said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Getting support from loved ones</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As dementia progresses, friends and family can play a crucial role in ensuring their loved one continues to hear and practice such mechanisms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Repetition and reinforcement are key when teaching coping and problem-solving skills to individuals with dementia in psychotherapy,” Krellman said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Involving close friends, family members, or other caregivers is often critical to assist the person in remembering skills taught in therapy.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Breathing and meditation exercises</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Confusion and loss of memory can exacerbate anxiety in people who have dementia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Dimitriu explained that practicing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mind-body/mindfulness-activities">mindfulness techniques</a>&nbsp;to bring them back to the present can encourage a sense of calm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These could include “breathing [exercises], [guided] relaxation, and even meditation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
